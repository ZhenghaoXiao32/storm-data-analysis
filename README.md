# Storm Data Analysis
Reproducible Research Project #2 of Coursera's Data Science Course

## Introduction
Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.

## Results
The analysis is based on U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. As a result, among all the severe weather types, Tornado and Spout contributed to most human injuries and fatalities while Wind and Storm caused the greatest economic damages followed by Flood and Surf.
